# What is kubernetes?
- Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It provides container-centric infrastructure that allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying hardware or software stack.

# What is container-centric infrastructure?
- Container-centric infrastructure refers to a computing environment where applications are packaged into containers. These containers encapsulate the application code, libraries, and dependencies, ensuring that the application runs consistently across different environments. Kubernetes manages these containers, providing features like load balancing, scaling, and self-healing.
  
- Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to deploy applications without needing to manage the details of the hardware or operating system. This abstraction enables easier scaling and management of applications, making it a popular choice for modern cloud-native development.
  
- Kubernetes is often used in conjunction with containerization technologies like Docker, which package applications into containers. This combination allows for efficient resource utilization and simplifies the deployment process across various environments, from development to production.
